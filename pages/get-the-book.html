getTheBook was developed in order to have multiple sources of data available to 
members of book clubs as they chose the next book or books to read for their group. 
A user may type an author, title, topic or any other word into the search field they 
are presented with on linking to the app. The user may click enter or the 'getTheBook' button. 
The next screen they are presented with is a listing of the top 10 books that are associated 
with the search term. The user can peruse initial information here, including ratings, publisher 
and a short synopsis. Once they click on a book to look at they are interested in, they are brought 
to a screen with more extensive information on the book, including a lengthier summary and details 
on purchasing the book through Google Play. If the book is available for purchase through Google Play, 
the user may click on that link and a new tab will open in Google Play and the user may make their purchase.
