Hi, I'm Missy Maloney. I'm a fullstack developer & UI/UX enthusiast.

Bio:

I am a Web Developer who is based in the Washington Metro Area. 
My interests include technology, music, sports, games, beer and the great outdoors. 
I pride myself in self-discipline and my thirst for efficiency. I also love sharing 
experiences, new discoveries, laughs, and smiles. Feel free to contact me or browse 
some of my projects using the links below.



am a web developer and recent graduate of the Front End Web Development Career Path 
bootcamp at Thinkful. I love coding because solving problems and seeing ideas come 
to life on the page is supremely satisfying. I geek out on higher order functions, 
finding and learning awesome libraries or frameworks, and getting front and back ends 
to play nicely.

When I'm not coding, I'm often found on Skype working with clients, curled up in a 
cozy chair reading, hiking in a canyon, or upside down doing a headstand. I am a lifelong l
earner and my current learning projects (beyond code!) include piano and writing my first book.
