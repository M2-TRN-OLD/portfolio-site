Executive Followup
My son has ADD. He has been a pretty good student but, as the schoolwork has become less structured and less controlled by the teacher, 
he has had difficulty keeping track of all his responsibilities. By the end of middle school, good executive functioning skills become 
critical. A student with ADD has challenges is this area (as most of us do!).

After trying a number of different methods to help him, I settled on meeting with him once a week myself to give him some of the 
"scaffolding" that was not there in high school. I borrowed from the Alcohol Anonymous, Weight Watchers and Catholic Mass schedule method 
of improvement: Meet each week, reflect on last week and plan for the next. Above all, keep the goal and your progress right in front of you. If you do this, you will likely see success.

executiveFollowUp is my attempt to create an automated tool that will yield more success by tracking data from the past week and 
keeping "what's due" always in front of the student.
